## 🚀 Overview

**IdeaBank** is a responsive web application built to empower users to capture, refine, and showcase ideas with real-time AI assistance. Designed for the GDG Campus Organizer Program, it integrates **Gemini API**, **Firebase Firestore**, and **Google IDX** to deliver a seamless user experience and intelligent content generation.
